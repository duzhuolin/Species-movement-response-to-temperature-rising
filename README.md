# Species_movement_response_to_temperature_rising
How different species residing in different temperature range response to the rising temperature resulted from climate change

Unsovled problems 
1. Using which distribution to assign the elelvation to each patch so that there will ba sevaral peaks and also the elevation changes smoothly. 
spline function

3. How to realize the species' ability to sense that one or several adjecent patches have been occupied by another species so that it can avoid moving to occupied patch. 
Set priority of all species or random selection among adjecent species to determine the moving order.

4. How to avoid errors when the species moves to the border of map? 
bouncing back/set up barrier/try function
